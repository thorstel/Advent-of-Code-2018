Advent of Code 2018
===================

I decided to use [Advent of Code 2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018) as an opportunity to take a look at the Ada programming language.

I did not write even a single line of Ada before doing this. While I try to write clean code for my solutions, you should not expect to find examples of best practices here.

In many cases I was too lazy to do the input handling inside my Ada programs. I often simply translated the input text file directly into Ada code (usally with vim macros). I wanted to focus on the actual problem (and learning the language) instead of trying to figure out how to do complex string parsing for the respective puzzle in Ada.

The following solutions do not process the original input files:

- Day 3
- Day 4 (probably my most elaborate pre-processing of the given input)
- Day 6
- Day 9
- Day 10
- Day 11 (did not have an input file)
- Day 12
- Day 14 (did not have an input file)
- Day 16
- Day 17
- Day 21
- Day 24
